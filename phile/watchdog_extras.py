    Monitors for file system events and notify interested handlers.

    .. admonition:: Raison d'Ãªtre

       The parent class :attr:`~watchdog.observers.Observer`
       provides :meth:`~watchdog.observers.api.BaseObserver.schedule`
       and
       :meth:`~watchdog.observers.api.BaseObserver.add_handler_for_watch`
       for registering,
       and :meth:`~watchdog.observers.api.BaseObserver.unschedule` and
       :meth:`~watchdog.observers.api.BaseObserver.remove_handler_for_watch`
       for deregistering,
       as being interested in certain file or directory changes.

       The :meth:`~watchdog.observers.api.BaseObserver.schedule` method
       sets up file monitoring of the given ``path``,
       and remembers which handlers to call for the ``path``.
       The
       :meth:`~watchdog.observers.api.BaseObserver.add_handler_for_watch`
       method does the same except it does not do the setting up.
       For predictability reasons,
       since :meth:`~watchdog.observers.api.BaseObserver.schedule`
       skips the setting up if its was already done,
       it should always be used over
       :meth:`~watchdog.observers.api.BaseObserver.add_handler_for_watch`,
       otherwise the handler may be registered against no monitoring
       except in simple use cases,
       or if the user does their own redundant tracking
       of :attr:`~watchdog.observers.api.ObservedWatch.path`-s.

       On the clean-up end,
       the :meth:`~watchdog.observers.api.BaseObserver.unschedule` method
       unregisters all handlers registered for a given
       :class:`~watchdog.observers.api.ObservedWatch`
       and stops monitoring the associated ``path``. whereas
       :meth:`~watchdog.observers.api.BaseObserver.remove_handler_for_watch`
       removes a single handler
       but without checking if the monitoring should stop.
       The former does not provide fine control over unregistering
       whereas the latter potentially leads to a inotify watch leak.

    This class introduces the :meth:`add_handler`
    and :meth:`remove_handler` methods.
    The latter provides finer control in the sense that
    it stops the monitoring if there are no more handlers registered
    for the given :class:`~watchdog.observers.api.ObservedWatch`.
    bridging functionality gaps
    in :attr:`~watchdog.observers.Observer`.
    It also ignores removal attempts after the observer is stopped.
    The former is identical
    to :meth:`~watchdog.observers.api.BaseObserver.schedule`,
    provided mainly for symmetry of operations,
    except the ``path`` parameter should be a :class:`~pathlib.Path`,
    for potential type checking purposes.

    This class also introduces :meth:`was_start_called`
    and :meth:`was_stop_called`
    to determine the status of the :class:`Observer`.
    They are sometimes useful in determining
    whether an :class:`Observer`
    can be :meth:`~watchdog.observers.api.BaseObserver.start`-ed
    since :meth:`~threading.Thread.start`-ing
    a :class:`~threading.Thread` twice raises an exception.

    Each instane remembers infomation necessary
    to start watching a directory or file
    so that starting requires only a single method call.

    There is a delay between the event being detected
    and the event being processed.
    This time may be sufficient for the files involved to be deleted
    or changed into a directory, etc.
    So the event type itself is not so useful.
    In particular, the user of file system events
    needs to handle such cases anyway at the point of file access.
    So the only reliable data from the event are the file paths
    indicating that some changes occured to the files of the path.
    It is then up to the user to determine what to do with the path
    depending on whether the path still exists, is still a file,
    has valid data or was already known about using their own data.
    So this scheduler accepts a handler that takes paths as an parameter
    instead of file system events.

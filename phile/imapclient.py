    .. admonition:: Raison d'Ãªtre:

        In the current implementation, an :class:`~imapclient.IMAPClient`
        can wait for IDLE messages after it enters IDLE mode.
        The :class:`~imapclient.IMAPClient` can either wait for messages
        with a given `timeout`, of possibly zero seconds,
        or wait indefinitely.
        This means that, to make it possible to exit IDLE mode early,
        the :class:`~imapclient.IMAPClient` needs to

          1. Check exit condition in a busy loop with a low `timeout`; or
          2. Send a `DONE` message to the server in a different thread,
             since, according to the IMAP specification,
             the client should not be sending anything else
             before this function returns.
             However, :class:`~imapclient.IMAPClient`
             is not officially thread-safe.
             And due to the way :meth:`~imapclient.IMAPClient.idle_check`
             is implemented,
             the server response for the `DONE` message
             would trigger an exception to be raised.
             In particular, this may cause any data
             being processed by :meth:`~imapclient.IMAPClient.idle_check`
             to be lost
             (though it may be possible to retrieve them from the stack,
             and to recover the response to `DONE` by mocking); or
          3. Forcibly drop the connection and reconnect.

        This coroutine provides a way
        to fetch messages in a cleaner way.

    .. admonition:: Implementation detail (Important for Windows)

       This coroutine currently waits on sockets
       using :meth:`~asyncio.loop.add_reader`
       of :func:`asyncio.get_running_loop`,
       and also :meth:`~asyncio.loop.remove_reader` for clean-up.
       These methods are not supported by
       :class:`~asyncio.ProactorEventLoop`
       according to :ref:`python:asyncio-platform-support`.
       This means the event loop used to run this coroutine
       cannot be a :class:`~asyncio.ProactorEventLoop`.

       At the time of writing (with Python on version 3.8),
       :class:`~asyncio.ProactorEventLoop` is the default event loop
       used in :mod:`asyncio` on Windows.
       This may be side-stepped
       by using :func:`asyncio.set_event_loop`
       together with a :class:`~asyncio.SelectorEventLoop`.
